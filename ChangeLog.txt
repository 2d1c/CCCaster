v2.1:
- Can host and connect without port forward
- Proper Linux / Wine support
- Command line options

v2.0d:
- Fixed a bug that sometimes causes weird inputs

v2.0c:
- Optimizations
- Added a lite version:
  Disables spectators (but can still spectate)
  Can't cancel out of host or join
  Everything else still works the same
  Try this version if you get slow downs
- Enables the disabled stages (thanks to Erkz for the memory locations)

v2.0b:
- Separate spectate only option, netplay option still works same as before
- Display both player names when spectating

v2.0a:
- Fixed the freeze that happens when spectating training mode
- Offline training mode reset button enhancement (like P4U)
  Tap reset + left/right to go to either corner (with gap)
  Hold reset + left/right makes player 1 go into the corner
  Hold down reset to go to player 2 starting position

v2.0:
New features:
- Replay saving works now
- Brand new interface
- Spectator mode
- Broadcast offline versus mode or training mode
- Netplay training mode
- Offline training mode with delay
- Better retry menu:
  Each side chooses their own retry option independently
  Can also manually save replays first
  Only chooses once again if both sides chose once again
  Note: once you make a selection, the game waits until the other side chooses something or exits
- Notification when someone connects (can be disabled):
  Can focus the caster window, otherwise it flashes on the taskbar
  Can also play a chime sound, which can be customized
- Starts the game with high CPU priority (can be disabled)
Minor changes and bug fixes:
- Better checksums, desyncs should rarely happen now
- Can cancel a pending connection with ESC

v1.1:
- Not compatible with older versions!
- Fixed the end of match crash issue
- Fixed the rest of the control issues
- Fixed possible desync issue

v1.0f:
- Fixed retry menu crash issue
- Fixed manually setting delay
- Increased timeout limit for non-ingame stuff, should make loading more stable

v1.0e:
- Better error messages for basic startup problems
- Clear clipboard at the end of each host session
- Fixed keyboard directions behaviour: MBAACC actually treats simultaneous left+right as left
  and up+down as down for keyboard ONLY, if this happens on a controller you just get neutral.
- Fixed AB and E macro behaviour: they should match the game exactly now. Remap if you use the AB macro

v1.0d:
- Fixed joystick controls again, remap by deleting cccaster.cfg if you have issues
- IP and port is now copied to the clipboard on host

v1.0c:
- Fixed crash on Windows XP, this may also fix the Windows 8 crash (untested).
- Increased timeout limit for the game, this should prevent crashes when loading / match over.
- Added reading from clipboard

v1.0b:
- Fixed keyboard control issues, you need to remap for it to work.
- There was a bug with version checking in v1.0a, so this version breaks compatibility.
  You should update even if you don't play on keyboard
