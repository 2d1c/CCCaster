How to host without port forward:

    Host on any port normally (you can use port 0 to pick any available port).

    Then the client connects to the same provided IP-address:port.

    Relaying is automatically performed, however it is not guaranteed to work for all networks.

    Some routers may be too restrictive, in which case you must open a port to netplay.


Other notes:

    If you use an analog controller, make sure to adjust the deadzone, else you might get weird inputs.

    You can change the netplay delay in-game by pressing Ctrl + Number on the keyboard.

    You can press and hold down the space-bar to prevent fast-forward when spectating.


Running under Wine:

    Must create a 32bit Wine prefix, see: http://askubuntu.com/a/257505

    No in-game button config unless someone can figure out how to hook DirectX9 under Wine.

    Can't save replays because MBAA.exe crashes when saving replays under Wine.
